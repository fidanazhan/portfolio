                <p>Hi and welcome to my small portfolio lodge. </p> 
                <br>
                <p> 
                    I am Fidan, a software engineer from Malaysia. I studied in Kyushu Institute of Technology, Japan focusing in data mining 
                    and software related fields. After I graduated, I started to work as a Data Scientist working for a chip manufacturer Japan 
                    company before continuing my career in software testing as Software Engineer for another international Japan company.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I learned to code when I was 18 years old starting with C++. During my diploma and bachelor study, I continued to learn and adapt 
                    in various programming languages like C, Java, Javascript, PHP, C# and Python. When I was in my final year in my university, I started to 
                    focus more on Python as I was doing data mining at that moment. Since I started my career, I have decided to focus more on these 
                    3 programming languages which are Python, Javascript and Java.
